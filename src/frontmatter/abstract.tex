\section*{Abstract}

In this document it has been investigated the applicability of a game theoretic approach for concurrency.
In particular the focus is on the scheduling of threads on a CPU, by first creating a model for a static
game where there are two threads competing for a single-core CPU, then defining a congestion game to
model the event of many threads competing for many CPU cores; proposing a repeated version of each of those games as well.
