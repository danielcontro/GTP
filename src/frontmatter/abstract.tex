\section*{Abstract}

In this document we investigate on the applicability of a game theoretic approach for concurrency.
In particular we focus on the scheduling of threads on a CPU, first we 
create a static game where there are 2 threads competing for a single-core CPU,
then we create a congestion game to model the event of many threads competing for many CPU cores.
We show a repeated version of each of those games.
