\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we modelled the resource allocation problem for singleprocessor
systems by designing a model that maximizes the social optimum and avoids
starvation, and a multiprocessor systems as a congestion game. A cost function 
has been proposed, and a theoretical experiment was conducted. This work shows
the theorical potential of the proposed system, and future works could explore
the performance of having more complex utility functions that take in account
other factors for evaluating the threads, such as energy consumption or
different frequencies.

Moreover it would be interesting to extend the single-core game to a
parametric number of players $n$ and determine how it performs in those
circumstances.

For what concerns the job-scheduling game, we focused on the formalization, and
we provided a simple solution for a infinitely repeated job-scheduling game.
Admittedly we focused on a very simple version of the job-scheduling game,
in our game each thread has the same duration and cost.
For instance in \cite{9244046}, which proposes a very similar formalization as the
one we used, the authors takes into account also energy consumption.
