\section{Conclusions}

For what concerns the job-scheduling game, we focused on the formalization, and
we provided a simple solution for a infinitely repeated job-scheduling game.
Admittedly we focused on a very simple version of the job-scheduling game,
in our game each thread has the same duration and cost.
For instance in \cite{9244046}, which proposes a very similar formalization as the
one we used, the authors takes into account also energy consumption.
