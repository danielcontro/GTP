\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we modelled the resource allocation problem for single- and multiprocessor systems as a congestion game. A cost function has been proposed, and a theoretical experiment was conducted. This work shows the potential of the proposed system, and future works can explore the performance of an auction game for modelling resource allocation.
