\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we modelled the resource allocation problem for singleprocessor
systems by designing a model that avoids starvation, and multiprocessor
systems as a congestion game. A cost function has been proposed, and a
theoretical experiment was conducted. This work shows the theorical potential
of the proposed system, and future works could explore the performance of
having more complex utility functions that take in account other factors for
evaluating the threads, such as energy consumption or different frequencies.

Moreover it would be interesting to extend the single-core game to a
parametric number of players $n$ and determine how it performs in those
circumstances.
