\section{Dynamic game of complete information}

In a real-world scenario where a scheduler has to queue threads for execution
the game is repeatedly played for each time slot or a batch of time slots.
In this case a simplification will be performed by considering as static base
game of a repeated game the previously analyzed one with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the threads will terminate after the same $d$ amount of time slots
    which could be unknown (in this case it will be an infinitely repeated game).
    \item each player wants to maximize its total payoff
    \item each player knows the outcome of each previous game
\end{itemize}

It will be used a discount factor $\delta < 1$ in order to try to maximize
the most the payoffs towards the start of the repeated game.

In the case where there's no pre-emption the scheduler will alternate
between the two Nash Equilibrium, since if there's no coordination
the strategies $(N, N)$ and $(E, E)$ will have a lower total
payoff, and if there's no change in the strategies there would be a problem
of starvation since a thread would never be executed.
Since there's coordination between the players a Tit-for-tat strategy could be
beneficial, because it would determine the alternation of two Nash Equilibriums,
a grim trigger strategy instead would lead to starvation since the thread with
lower payoff when executed would never be scheduled for execution.
