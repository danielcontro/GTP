\section{Static game of incomplete information}

The first base case of the scheduling problem considered is the one where
there are only two threads that are ready to be executed, there's no
pre-emption and the system has only one computational unit (CPU). 
In this case the set of players 

\begin{game}{2}{2}
  $T_1/T_2$ & Nop   & Run \\
  Nop     & $f_1(s_{NN}), f_2(s_{NN})$  & $f_1(s_{NR}), f_2(s_{NR})$ \\
  Run     & $f_1(s_{RN}), f_2(s_{RN})$ & $f_1(s_{RR}), f_2(s_{RR})$
\end{game}
